# 1.1. A Bit of History

The Java® programming language is a general-purpose, concurrent, object-oriented language. Its syntax is similar to C and C++, but it omits many of the features that make C and C++ complex, confusing, and unsafe. The Java platform was initially developed to address the problems of building software for networked consumer devices. It was designed to support multiple host architectures and to allow secure delivery of software components. To meet these requirements, compiled code had to survive transport across networks, operate on any client, and assure the client that it was safe to run.

Java® 编程语言是一种通用的、并发的、面向对象的语言。它的语法类似于 C 和 C++ ，但它省略了许多使 C 和 C++ 变得复杂、令人困惑和不安全的特性。 Java 平台最初是为了解决为联网消费设备构建软件的问题而开发的。它旨在支持多种主机架构并允许安全交付软件组件。为了满足这些要求，编译后的代码必须能够跨网络传输，在任何客户端上运行，并确保客户端可以安全运行。

The popularization of the World Wide Web made these attributes much more interesting. Web browsers enabled millions of people to surf the Net and access media-rich content in simple ways. At last there was a medium where what you saw and heard was essentially the same regardless of the machine you were using and whether it was connected to a fast network or a slow modem.

万维网的普及使这些属性变得更加有趣。 Web 浏览器使数百万人能够以简单的方式上网和访问富媒体内容。终于出现了一种媒介，无论您使用的是何种机器，无论它连接到快速网络还是慢速调制解调器，您所看到和听到的内容都基本相同。

Web enthusiasts soon discovered that the content supported by the Web's HTML document format was too limited. HTML extensions, such as forms, only highlighted those limitations, while making it clear that no browser could include all the features users wanted. Extensibility was the answer.

Web 爱好者很快发现 Web 的 HTML 文档格式支持的内容太有限了。 HTML 扩展，例如表单，只强调了这些限制，同时明确表示没有浏览器可以包含用户想要的所有功能。可扩展性就是答案。

The HotJava browser first showcased the interesting properties of the Java programming language and platform by making it possible to embed programs inside HTML pages. Programs are transparently downloaded into the browser along with the HTML pages in which they appear. Before being accepted by the browser, programs are carefully checked to make sure they are safe. Like HTML pages, compiled programs are network- and host-independent. The programs behave the same way regardless of where they come from or what kind of machine they are being loaded into and run on.

A Web browser incorporating the Java platform is no longer limited to a predetermined set of capabilities. Visitors to Web pages incorporating dynamic content can be assured that their machines cannot be damaged by that content. Programmers can write a program once, and it will run on any machine supplying a Java run-time environment.
