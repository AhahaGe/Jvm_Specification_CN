# 4.4. The Constant Pool

Java Virtual Machine instructions do not rely on the run-time layout of classes, interfaces, class instances, or arrays. Instead, instructions refer to symbolic information in the `constant_pool` table.

All `constant_pool` table entries have the following general format:

```text
cp_info {
    u1 tag;
    u1 info[];
}
```

Each item in the `constant_pool` table must begin with a 1-byte tag indicating the kind of `cp_info` entry. The contents of the `info` array vary with the value of `tag`. The valid tags and their values are listed in [Table 4.4-A](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4-140). Each tag byte must be followed by two or more bytes giving information about the specific constant. The format of the additional information varies with the tag value.

**Table 4.4-A. Constant pool tags**

| Constant Type | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| `CONSTANT_Class` | 7 |
| `CONSTANT_Fieldref` | 9 |
| `CONSTANT_Methodref` | 10 |
| `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref` | 11 |
| `CONSTANT_String` | 8 |
| `CONSTANT_Integer` | 3 |
| `CONSTANT_Float` | 4 |
| `CONSTANT_Long` | 5 |
| `CONSTANT_Double` | 6 |
| `CONSTANT_NameAndType` | 12 |
| `CONSTANT_Utf8` | 1 |
| `CONSTANT_MethodHandle` | 15 |
| `CONSTANT_MethodType` | 16 |
| `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic` | 18 |

#### 4.4.1. The `CONSTANT_Class_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure is used to represent a class or an interface:

```text
CONSTANT_Class_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 name_index;
}
```

The items of the `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure are as follows:tag

The `tag` item has the value `CONSTANT_Class` \(7\).name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure \([§4.4.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7)\) representing a valid binary class or interface name encoded in internal form \([§4.2.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.1)\).

Because arrays are objects, the opcodes _anewarray_ and _multianewarray_ - but not the opcode _new_ - can reference array "classes" via `CONSTANT_Class_info` structures in the `constant_pool` table. For such array classes, the name of the class is the descriptor of the array type \([§4.3.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2)\).

For example, the class name representing the two-dimensional array type `int[][]` is `[[I`, while the class name representing the type `Thread[]` is `[Ljava/lang/Thread;`.

An array type descriptor is valid only if it represents 255 or fewer dimensions.

#### 4.4.2. The `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info`, `CONSTANT_Methodref_info`, and `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` Structures

Fields, methods, and interface methods are represented by similar structures:

```text
CONSTANT_Fieldref_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 class_index;
    u2 name_and_type_index;
}

CONSTANT_Methodref_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 class_index;
    u2 name_and_type_index;
}

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 class_index;
    u2 name_and_type_index;
}
```

The items of these structures are as follows:tag

The `tag` item of a `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Fieldref` \(9\).

The `tag` item of a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Methodref` \(10\).

The `tag` item of a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref` \(11\).class\_index

The value of the `class_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure \([§4.4.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1)\) representing a class or interface type that has the field or method as a member.

The `class_index` item of a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure must be a class type, not an interface type.

The `class_index` item of a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure must be an interface type.

The `class_index` item of a `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info` structure may be either a class type or an interface type.name\_and\_type\_index

The value of the `name_and_type_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure \([§4.4.6](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.6)\). This `constant_pool` entry indicates the name and descriptor of the field or method.

In a `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info`, the indicated descriptor must be a field descriptor \([§4.3.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2)\). Otherwise, the indicated descriptor must be a method descriptor \([§4.3.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3)\).

If the name of the method of a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure begins with a '`<`' \('`\u003c`'\), then the name must be the special name `<init>`, representing an instance initialization method \([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)\). The return type of such a method must be `void`.

#### 4.4.3. The `CONSTANT_String_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_String_info` structure is used to represent constant objects of the type `String`:

```text
CONSTANT_String_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 string_index;
}
```

The items of the `CONSTANT_String_info` structure are as follows:tag

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_String_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_String` \(8\).string\_index

The value of the `string_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure \([§4.4.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7)\) representing the sequence of Unicode code points to which the `String` object is to be initialized.

#### 4.4.4. The `CONSTANT_Integer_info` and `CONSTANT_Float_info` Structures

The `CONSTANT_Integer_info` and `CONSTANT_Float_info` structures represent 4-byte numeric \(`int` and `float`\) constants:

```text
CONSTANT_Integer_info {
    u1 tag;
    u4 bytes;
}

CONSTANT_Float_info {
    u1 tag;
    u4 bytes;
}
```

The items of these structures are as follows:tag

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_Integer_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Integer` \(3\).

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_Float_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Float` \(4\).bytes

The `bytes` item of the `CONSTANT_Integer_info` structure represents the value of the `int` constant. The bytes of the value are stored in big-endian \(high byte first\) order.

The `bytes` item of the `CONSTANT_Float_info` structure represents the value of the `float` constant in IEEE 754 floating-point single format \([§2.3.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.3.2)\). The bytes of the single format representation are stored in big-endian \(high byte first\) order.

The value represented by the `CONSTANT_Float_info` structure is determined as follows. The bytes of the value are first converted into an `int` constant _bits_. Then:

* If _bits_ is `0x7f800000`, the `float` value will be positive infinity.
* If _bits_ is `0xff800000`, the `float` value will be negative infinity.
* If _bits_ is in the range `0x7f800001` through `0x7fffffff` or in the range `0xff800001` through `0xffffffff`, the `float` value will be NaN.
* In all other cases, let `s`, `e`, and `m` be three values that might be computed from _bits_:

  ```text
  int s = ((bits >> 31) == 0) ? 1 : -1;
  int e = ((bits >> 23) & 0xff);
  int m = (e == 0) ?
            (bits & 0x7fffff) << 1 :
            (bits & 0x7fffff) | 0x800000;
  ```

Then the `float` value equals the result of the mathematical expression `s · m · 2e-150`.

#### 4.4.5. The `CONSTANT_Long_info` and `CONSTANT_Double_info` Structures

The `CONSTANT_Long_info` and `CONSTANT_Double_info` represent 8-byte numeric \(`long` and `double`\) constants:

```text
CONSTANT_Long_info {
    u1 tag;
    u4 high_bytes;
    u4 low_bytes;
}

CONSTANT_Double_info {
    u1 tag;
    u4 high_bytes;
    u4 low_bytes;
}
```

All 8-byte constants take up two entries in the `constant_pool` table of the `class` file. If a `CONSTANT_Long_info` or `CONSTANT_Double_info` structure is the item in the `constant_pool` table at index _n_, then the next usable item in the pool is located at index _n_+2. The `constant_pool` index _n_+1 must be valid but is considered unusable.

In retrospect, making 8-byte constants take two constant pool entries was a poor choice.

The items of these structures are as follows:tag

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_Long_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Long` \(5\).

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_Double_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Double` \(6\).high\_bytes, low\_bytes

The unsigned `high_bytes` and `low_bytes` items of the `CONSTANT_Long_info` structure together represent the value of the `long` constant

```text
((long) high_bytes << 32) + low_bytes
```

where the bytes of each of `high_bytes` and `low_bytes` are stored in big-endian \(high byte first\) order.

The `high_bytes` and `low_bytes` items of the `CONSTANT_Double_info` structure together represent the `double` value in IEEE 754 floating-point double format \([§2.3.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.3.2)\). The bytes of each item are stored in big-endian \(high byte first\) order.

The value represented by the `CONSTANT_Double_info` structure is determined as follows. The `high_bytes` and `low_bytes` items are converted into the `long` constant _bits_, which is equal to

```text
((long) high_bytes << 32) + low_bytes
```

Then:

* If _bits_ is `0x7ff0000000000000L`, the `double` value will be positive infinity.
* If _bits_ is `0xfff0000000000000L`, the `double` value will be negative infinity.
* If _bits_ is in the range `0x7ff0000000000001L` through `0x7fffffffffffffffL` or in the range `0xfff0000000000001L` through `0xffffffffffffffffL`, the double value will be NaN.
* In all other cases, let `s`, `e`, and `m` be three values that might be computed from _bits_:

  ```text
  int s = ((bits >> 63) == 0) ? 1 : -1;
  int e = (int)((bits >> 52) & 0x7ffL);
  long m = (e == 0) ?
             (bits & 0xfffffffffffffL) << 1 :
             (bits & 0xfffffffffffffL) | 0x10000000000000L;
  ```

Then the floating-point value equals the `double` value of the mathematical expression `s · m · 2e-1075`.

#### 4.4.6. The `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure is used to represent a field or method, without indicating which class or interface type it belongs to:

```text
CONSTANT_NameAndType_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 name_index;
    u2 descriptor_index;
}
```

The items of the `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure are as follows:tag

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_NameAndType` \(12\).name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure \([§4.4.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7)\) representing either the special method name `<init>` \([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)\) or a valid unqualified name denoting a field or method \([§4.2.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.2)\).descriptor\_index

The value of the `descriptor_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure \([§4.4.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7)\) representing a valid field descriptor or method descriptor \([§4.3.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2), [§4.3.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3)\).

#### 4.4.7. The `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure is used to represent constant string values:

```text
CONSTANT_Utf8_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 length;
    u1 bytes[length];
}
```

The items of the `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure are as follows:tag

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Utf8` \(1\).length

The value of the `length` item gives the number of bytes in the `bytes` array \(not the length of the resulting string\).bytes\[\]

The `bytes` array contains the bytes of the string.

No byte may have the value `(byte)0`.

No byte may lie in the range `(byte)0xf0` to `(byte)0xff`.

String content is encoded in modified UTF-8. Modified UTF-8 strings are encoded so that code point sequences that contain only non-null ASCII characters can be represented using only 1 byte per code point, but all code points in the Unicode codespace can be represented. Modified UTF-8 strings are not null-terminated. The encoding is as follows:

* Code points in the range '`\u0001`' to '`\u007F`' are represented by a single byte:

  **Table 4.4.** 

  | _0_ | _bits 6-0_ |
  | :--- | :--- |


  The 7 bits of data in the byte give the value of the code point represented.

* The null code point \('`\u0000`'\) and code points in the range '`\u0080`' to '`\u07FF`' are represented by a pair of bytes `x` and `y` :

  **Table 4.5.** 

  | `x`: | **Table 4.6.**  |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | `y`: | **Table 4.7.**  |

  The two bytes represent the code point with the value:

  ```text
  ((x & 0x1f) << 6) + (y & 0x3f)
  ```

* Code points in the range '`\u0800`' to '`\uFFFF`' are represented by 3 bytes `x`, `y`, and `z` :

  **Table 4.8.** 

  | `x`: | **Table 4.9.**  |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | `y`: | **Table 4.10.**  |
  | `z`: | **Table 4.11.**  |

  The three bytes represent the code point with the value:

  ```text
  ((x & 0xf) << 12) + ((y & 0x3f) << 6) + (z & 0x3f)
  ```

* Characters with code points above U+FFFF \(so-called _supplementary characters_\) are represented by separately encoding the two surrogate code units of their UTF-16 representation. Each of the surrogate code units is represented by three bytes. This means supplementary characters are represented by six bytes, `u`, `v`, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` :

  **Table 4.12.** 

  | `u`: | **Table 4.13.**  |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | `v`: | **Table 4.14.**  |
  | `w`: | **Table 4.15.**  |
  | `x`: | **Table 4.16.**  |
  | `y`: | **Table 4.17.**  |
  | `z`: | **Table 4.18.**  |

  The six bytes represent the code point with the value:

  ```text
  0x10000 + ((v & 0x0f) << 16) + ((w & 0x3f) << 10) +
  ((y & 0x0f) << 6) + (z & 0x3f)
  ```

The bytes of multibyte characters are stored in the `class` file in big-endian \(high byte first\) order.

There are two differences between this format and the "standard" UTF-8 format. First, the null character `(char)0` is encoded using the 2-byte format rather than the 1-byte format, so that modified UTF-8 strings never have embedded nulls. Second, only the 1-byte, 2-byte, and 3-byte formats of standard UTF-8 are used. The Java Virtual Machine does not recognize the four-byte format of standard UTF-8; it uses its own two-times-three-byte format instead.

For more information regarding the standard UTF-8 format, see Section 3.9 _Unicode Encoding Forms_ of _The Unicode Standard, Version 6.0.0_.

#### 4.4.8. The `CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info` structure is used to represent a method handle:

```text
CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info {
    u1 tag;
    u1 reference_kind;
    u2 reference_index;
}
```

The items of the `CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info` structure are the following:tag

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_MethodHandle` \(15\).reference\_kind

The value of the `reference_kind` item must be in the range 1 to 9. The value denotes the _kind_ of this method handle, which characterizes its bytecode behavior \([§5.4.3.5](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.3.5)\).reference\_index

The value of the `reference_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be as follows:

* If the value of the `reference_kind` item is 1 \(`REF_getField`\), 2 \(`REF_getStatic`\), 3 \(`REF_putField`\), or 4 \(`REF_putStatic`\), then the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info` \([§4.4.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.2)\) structure representing a field for which a method handle is to be created.
* If the value of the `reference_kind` item is 5 \(`REF_invokeVirtual`\) or 8 \(`REF_newInvokeSpecial`\), then the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure \([§4.4.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.2)\) representing a class's method or constructor \([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)\) for which a method handle is to be created.
* If the value of the `reference_kind` item is 6 \(`REF_invokeStatic`\) or 7 \(`REF_invokeSpecial`\), then if the `class` file version number is less than 52.0, the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure representing a class's method for which a method handle is to be created; if the `class` file version number is 52.0 or above, the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be either a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure or a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure \([§4.4.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.2)\) representing a class's or interface's method for which a method handle is to be created.
* If the value of the `reference_kind` item is 9 \(`REF_invokeInterface`\), then the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure representing an interface's method for which a method handle is to be created.

If the value of the `reference_kind` item is 5 \(`REF_invokeVirtual`\), 6 \(`REF_invokeStatic`\), 7 \(`REF_invokeSpecial`\), or 9 \(`REF_invokeInterface`\), the name of the method represented by a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure or a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure must not be `<init>` or `<clinit>`.

If the value is 8 \(`REF_newInvokeSpecial`\), the name of the method represented by a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure must be `<init>`.

#### 4.4.9. The `CONSTANT_MethodType_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_MethodType_info` structure is used to represent a method type:

```text
CONSTANT_MethodType_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 descriptor_index;
}
```

The items of the `CONSTANT_MethodType_info` structure are as follows:tag

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_MethodType_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_MethodType` \(16\).descriptor\_index

The value of the `descriptor_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure \([§4.4.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7)\) representing a method descriptor \([§4.3.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3)\).

#### 4.4.10. The `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` structure is used by an _invokedynamic_ instruction \([§_invokedynamic_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokedynamic)\) to specify a bootstrap method, the dynamic invocation name, the argument and return types of the call, and optionally, a sequence of additional constants called _static arguments_ to the bootstrap method.

```text
CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 bootstrap_method_attr_index;
    u2 name_and_type_index;
}
```

The items of the `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` structure are as follows:tag

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic` \(18\).bootstrap\_method\_attr\_index

The value of the `bootstrap_method_attr_index` item must be a valid index into the `bootstrap_methods` array of the bootstrap method table \([§4.7.23](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.23)\) of this `class` file.name\_and\_type\_index

The value of the `name_and_type_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure \([§4.4.6](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.6)\) representing a method name and method descriptor \([§4.3.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3)\).
