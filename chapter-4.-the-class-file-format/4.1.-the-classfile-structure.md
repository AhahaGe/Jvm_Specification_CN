# 4.1. The ClassFile Structure

A `class` file consists of a single `ClassFile` structure:

```text
ClassFile {
    u4             magic;
    u2             minor_version;
    u2             major_version;
    u2             constant_pool_count;
    cp_info        constant_pool[constant_pool_count-1];
    u2             access_flags;
    u2             this_class;
    u2             super_class;
    u2             interfaces_count;
    u2             interfaces[interfaces_count];
    u2             fields_count;
    field_info     fields[fields_count];
    u2             methods_count;
    method_info    methods[methods_count];
    u2             attributes_count;
    attribute_info attributes[attributes_count];
}
```

The items in the `ClassFile` structure are as follows:magic

The `magic` item supplies the magic number identifying the `class` file format; it has the value `0xCAFEBABE`.minor\_version, major\_version

The values of the `minor_version` and `major_version` items are the minor and major version numbers of this `class` file. Together, a major and a minor version number determine the version of the `class` file format. If a `class` file has major version number M and minor version number m, we denote the version of its `class` file format as M.m. Thus, `class` file format versions may be ordered lexicographically, for example, 1.5 &lt; 2.0 &lt; 2.1.

A Java Virtual Machine implementation can support a `class` file format of version v if and only if v lies in some contiguous range Mi.0 ≤ v ≤ Mj.m. The release level of the Java SE platform to which a Java Virtual Machine implementation conforms is responsible for determining the range.

Oracle's Java Virtual Machine implementation in JDK release 1.0.2 supports `class` file format versions 45.0 through 45.3 inclusive. JDK releases 1.1.\* support `class` file format versions in the range 45.0 through 45.65535 inclusive. For k ≥ 2, JDK release 1.k supports `class` file format versions in the range 45.0 through 44+k.0 inclusive.constant\_pool\_count

The value of the `constant_pool_count` item is equal to the number of entries in the `constant_pool` table plus one. A `constant_pool` index is considered valid if it is greater than zero and less than `constant_pool_count`, with the exception for constants of type `long` and `double` noted in [§4.4.5](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.5).constant\_pool\[\]

The `constant_pool` is a table of structures \([§4.4](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4)\) representing various string constants, class and interface names, field names, and other constants that are referred to within the `ClassFile` structure and its substructures. The format of each `constant_pool` table entry is indicated by its first "tag" byte.

The `constant_pool` table is indexed from 1 to `constant_pool_count` - 1.access\_flags

The value of the `access_flags` item is a mask of flags used to denote access permissions to and properties of this class or interface. The interpretation of each flag, when set, is specified in [Table 4.1-A](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1-200-E.1).

**Table 4.1-A. Class access and property modifiers**

| Flag Name | Value | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ACC_PUBLIC` | 0x0001 | Declared `public`; may be accessed from outside its package. |
| `ACC_FINAL` | 0x0010 | Declared `final`; no subclasses allowed. |
| `ACC_SUPER` | 0x0020 | Treat superclass methods specially when invoked by the _invokespecial_ instruction. |
| `ACC_INTERFACE` | 0x0200 | Is an interface, not a class. |
| `ACC_ABSTRACT` | 0x0400 | Declared `abstract`; must not be instantiated. |
| `ACC_SYNTHETIC` | 0x1000 | Declared synthetic; not present in the source code. |
| `ACC_ANNOTATION` | 0x2000 | Declared as an annotation type. |
| `ACC_ENUM` | 0x4000 | Declared as an `enum` type. |

An interface is distinguished by the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag being set. If the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag is not set, this `class` file defines a class, not an interface.

If the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag is set, the `ACC_ABSTRACT` flag must also be set, and the `ACC_FINAL`, `ACC_SUPER`, and `ACC_ENUM` flags set must not be set.

If the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag is not set, any of the other flags in [Table 4.1-A](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1-200-E.1) may be set except `ACC_ANNOTATION`. However, such a `class` file must not have both its `ACC_FINAL` and `ACC_ABSTRACT` flags set \(JLS §8.1.1.2\).

The `ACC_SUPER` flag indicates which of two alternative semantics is to be expressed by the _invokespecial_ instruction \([§_invokespecial_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokespecial)\) if it appears in this class or interface. Compilers to the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine should set the `ACC_SUPER` flag. In Java SE 8 and above, the Java Virtual Machine considers the `ACC_SUPER` flag to be set in every `class` file, regardless of the actual value of the flag in the `class` file and the version of the `class` file.

The `ACC_SUPER` flag exists for backward compatibility with code compiled by older compilers for the Java programming language. In JDK releases prior to 1.0.2, the compiler generated `access_flags` in which the flag now representing `ACC_SUPER` had no assigned meaning, and Oracle's Java Virtual Machine implementation ignored the flag if it was set.

The `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flag indicates that this class or interface was generated by a compiler and does not appear in source code.

An annotation type must have its `ACC_ANNOTATION` flag set. If the `ACC_ANNOTATION` flag is set, the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag must also be set.

The `ACC_ENUM` flag indicates that this class or its superclass is declared as an enumerated type.

All bits of the `access_flags` item not assigned in [Table 4.1-A](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1-200-E.1) are reserved for future use. They should be set to zero in generated `class` files and should be ignored by Java Virtual Machine implementations.this\_class

The value of the `this_class` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure \([§4.4.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1)\) representing the class or interface defined by this `class` file.super\_class

For a class, the value of the `super_class` item either must be zero or must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. If the value of the `super_class` item is nonzero, the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing the direct superclass of the class defined by this `class` file. Neither the direct superclass nor any of its superclasses may have the `ACC_FINAL` flag set in the `access_flags` item of its `ClassFile` structure.

If the value of the `super_class` item is zero, then this `class` file must represent the class `Object`, the only class or interface without a direct superclass.

For an interface, the value of the `super_class` item must always be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing the class `Object`.interfaces\_count

The value of the `interfaces_count` item gives the number of direct superinterfaces of this class or interface type.interfaces\[\]

Each value in the `interfaces` array must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at each value of `interfaces[`_`i`_`]`, where 0 ≤ _i_ &lt; `interfaces_count`, must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing an interface that is a direct superinterface of this class or interface type, in the left-to-right order given in the source for the type.fields\_count

The value of the `fields_count` item gives the number of `field_info` structures in the `fields` table. The `field_info` structures represent all fields, both class variables and instance variables, declared by this class or interface type.fields\[\]

Each value in the `fields` table must be a `field_info` structure \([§4.5](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5)\) giving a complete description of a field in this class or interface. The `fields` table includes only those fields that are declared by this class or interface. It does not include items representing fields that are inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces.methods\_count

The value of the `methods_count` item gives the number of `method_info` structures in the `methods` table.methods\[\]

Each value in the `methods` table must be a `method_info` structure \([§4.6](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6)\) giving a complete description of a method in this class or interface. If neither of the `ACC_NATIVE` and `ACC_ABSTRACT` flags are set in the `access_flags` item of a `method_info` structure, the Java Virtual Machine instructions implementing the method are also supplied.

The `method_info` structures represent all methods declared by this class or interface type, including instance methods, class methods, instance initialization methods \([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)\), and any class or interface initialization method \([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)\). The `methods` table does not include items representing methods that are inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces.attributes\_count

The value of the `attributes_count` item gives the number of attributes in the `attributes` table of this class.attributes\[\]

Each value of the `attributes` table must be an `attribute_info` structure \([§4.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7)\).

The attributes defined by this specification as appearing in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure are listed in [Table 4.7-C](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7-320).

The rules concerning attributes defined to appear in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure are given in [§4.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7).

The rules concerning non-predefined attributes in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure are given in [§4.7.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.1).
