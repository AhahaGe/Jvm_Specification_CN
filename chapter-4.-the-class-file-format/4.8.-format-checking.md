# 4.8. Format Checking

When a prospective `class` file is loaded by the Java Virtual Machine \([ยง5.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.3)\), the Java Virtual Machine first ensures that the file has the basic format of a `class` file \([ยง4.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1)\). This process is known as _format checking_. The checks are as follows:

* The first four bytes must contain the right magic number.
* All recognized attributes must be of the proper length.
* The `class` file must not be truncated or have extra bytes at the end.
* The constant pool must satisfy the constraints documented throughout [ยง4.4](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4).

  For example, each `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure in the constant pool must contain in its `name_index` item a valid constant pool index for a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure.

* All field references and method references in the constant pool must have valid names, valid classes, and valid descriptors \([ยง4.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3)\).

  Format checking does not ensure that the given field or method actually exists in the given class, nor that the descriptors given refer to real classes. Format checking ensures only that these items are well formed. More detailed checking is performed when the bytecodes themselves are verified, and during resolution.

These checks for basic `class` file integrity are necessary for any interpretation of the `class` file contents. Format checking is distinct from bytecode verification, although historically they have been confused because both are a form of integrity check.
