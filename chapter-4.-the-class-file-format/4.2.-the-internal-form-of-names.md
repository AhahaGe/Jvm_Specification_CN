# 4.2. The Internal Form of Names

#### 4.2.1. Binary Class and Interface Names

Class and interface names that appear in `class` file structures are always represented in a fully qualified form known as _binary names_ \(JLS §13.1\). Such names are always represented as `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structures \([§4.4.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7)\) and thus may be drawn, where not further constrained, from the entire Unicode codespace. Class and interface names are referenced from those `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structures \([§4.4.6](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.6)\) which have such names as part of their descriptor \([§4.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3)\), and from all `CONSTANT_Class_info` structures \([§4.4.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1)\).

For historical reasons, the syntax of binary names that appear in `class` file structures differs from the syntax of binary names documented in JLS §13.1. In this internal form, the ASCII periods \(`.`\) that normally separate the identifiers which make up the binary name are replaced by ASCII forward slashes \(`/`\). The identifiers themselves must be unqualified names \([§4.2.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.2)\).

For example, the normal binary name of class `Thread` is `java.lang.Thread`. In the internal form used in descriptors in the `class` file format, a reference to the name of class `Thread` is implemented using a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing the string `java/lang/Thread`.

#### 4.2.2. Unqualified Names

Names of methods, fields, local variables, and formal parameters are stored as _unqualified names_. An unqualified name must contain at least one Unicode code point and must not contain any of the ASCII characters `.` `;` `[` `/` \(that is, period or semicolon or left square bracket or forward slash\).

Method names are further constrained so that, with the exception of the special method names `<init>` and `<clinit>` \([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)\), they must not contain the ASCII characters `<` or `>` \(that is, left angle bracket or right angle bracket\).

Note that a field name or interface method name may be `<init>` or `<clinit>`, but no method invocation instruction may reference `<clinit>` and only the _invokespecial_ instruction \([§_invokespecial_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokespecial)\) may reference `<init>`.
