# 4.3. Descriptors

A _descriptor_ is a string representing the type of a field or method. Descriptors are represented in the `class` file format using modified UTF-8 strings \([ยง4.4.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7)\) and thus may be drawn, where not further constrained, from the entire Unicode codespace.

#### 4.3.1. Grammar Notation

Descriptors are specified using a grammar. The grammar is a set of productions that describe how sequences of characters can form syntactically correct descriptors of various kinds. Terminal symbols of the grammar are shown in `fixed width` font. Nonterminal symbols are shown in _italic_ type. The definition of a nonterminal is introduced by the name of the nonterminal being defined, followed by a colon. One or more alternative definitions for the nonterminal then follow on succeeding lines.

The syntax _{x}_ on the right-hand side of a production denotes zero or more occurrences of _x_.

The phrase _\(one of\)_ on the right-hand side of a production signifies that each of the terminal symbols on the following line or lines is an alternative definition.

#### 4.3.2. Field Descriptors

A _field descriptor_ represents the type of a class, instance, or local variable.FieldDescriptor:[FieldType](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-FieldType)FieldType:[BaseType](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-BaseType)  
[ObjectType](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-ObjectType)  
[ArrayType](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-ArrayType)BaseType:\(one of\)  
`B` `C` `D` `F` `I` `J` `S` `Z`ObjectType:`L` ClassName `;`ArrayType:`[` [ComponentType](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-ComponentType)ComponentType:[FieldType](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-FieldType)

The characters of _BaseType_, the `L` and `;` of _ObjectType_, and the `[` of _ArrayType_ are all ASCII characters.

_ClassName_ represents a binary class or interface name encoded in internal form \([ยง4.2.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.1)\).

The interpretation of field descriptors as types is shown in [Table 4.3-A](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2-200).

A field descriptor representing an array type is valid only if it represents a type with 255 or fewer dimensions.

**Table 4.3-A. Interpretation of field descriptors**

| _FieldType_ term | Type | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `B` | `byte` | signed byte |
| `C` | `char` | Unicode character code point in the Basic Multilingual Plane, encoded with UTF-16 |
| `D` | `double` | double-precision floating-point value |
| `F` | `float` | single-precision floating-point value |
| `I` | `int` | integer |
| `J` | `long` | long integer |
| `L` _ClassName_ `;` | `reference` | an instance of class _ClassName_ |
| `S` | `short` | signed short |
| `Z` | `boolean` | `true` or `false` |
| `[` | `reference` | one array dimension |

The field descriptor of an instance variable of type `int` is simply `I`.

The field descriptor of an instance variable of type `Object` is `Ljava/lang/Object;`. Note that the internal form of the binary name for class `Object` is used.

The field descriptor of an instance variable of the multidimensional array type `double[][][]` is `[[[D`.

#### 4.3.3. Method Descriptors

A _method descriptor_ contains zero or more _parameter descriptors_, representing the types of parameters that the method takes, and a _return descriptor_, representing the type of the value \(if any\) that the method returns.MethodDescriptor:`(` {[ParameterDescriptor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-ParameterDescriptor)} `)` [ReturnDescriptor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-ReturnDescriptor)ParameterDescriptor:[FieldType](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-FieldType)ReturnDescriptor:[FieldType](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-FieldType)  
[VoidDescriptor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-VoidDescriptor)VoidDescriptor:`V`

The character `V` indicates that the method returns no value \(its result is `void`\).

The method descriptor for the method:

```text
Object m(int i, double d, Thread t) {...}
```

is:

```text
(IDLjava/lang/Thread;)Ljava/lang/Object;
```

Note that the internal forms of the binary names of `Thread` and `Object` are used.

A method descriptor is valid only if it represents method parameters with a total length of 255 or less, where that length includes the contribution for `this` in the case of instance or interface method invocations. The total length is calculated by summing the contributions of the individual parameters, where a parameter of type `long` or `double` contributes two units to the length and a parameter of any other type contributes one unit.

A method descriptor is the same whether the method it describes is a class method or an instance method. Although an instance method is passed `this`, a reference to the object on which the method is being invoked, in addition to its intended arguments, that fact is not reflected in the method descriptor. The reference to `this` is passed implicitly by the Java Virtual Machine instructions which invoke instance methods \([ยง2.6.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6.1), [ยง4.11](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.11)\).
