# 5.2. Java Virtual Machine Startup

The Java Virtual Machine starts up by creating an initial class, which is specified in an implementation-dependent manner, using the bootstrap class loader \([ยง5.3.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.3.1)\). The Java Virtual Machine then links the initial class, initializes it, and invokes the `public` class method `void main(String[])`. The invocation of this method drives all further execution. Execution of the Java Virtual Machine instructions constituting the `main` method may cause linking \(and consequently creation\) of additional classes and interfaces, as well as invocation of additional methods.

In an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine, the initial class could be provided as a command line argument. Alternatively, the implementation could provide an initial class that sets up a class loader which in turn loads an application. Other choices of the initial class are possible so long as they are consistent with the specification given in the previous paragraph.
