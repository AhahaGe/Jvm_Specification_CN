# 5.6. Binding Native Method Implementations

_Binding_ is the process by which a function written in a language other than the Java programming language and implementing a `native` method is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine so that it can be executed. Although this process is traditionally referred to as linking, the term binding is used in the specification to avoid confusion with linking of classes or interfaces by the Java Virtual Machine.
