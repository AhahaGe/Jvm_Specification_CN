# Chapter 5. Loading, Linking, and Initializing

The Java Virtual Machine dynamically loads, links and initializes classes and interfaces. Loading is the process of finding the binary representation of a class or interface type with a particular name and _creating_ a class or interface from that binary representation. Linking is the process of taking a class or interface and combining it into the run-time state of the Java Virtual Machine so that it can be executed. Initialization of a class or interface consists of executing the class or interface initialization method `<clinit>` \([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)\).

In this chapter, [§5.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.1) describes how the Java Virtual Machine derives symbolic references from the binary representation of a class or interface. [§5.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.2) explains how the processes of loading, linking, and initialization are first initiated by the Java Virtual Machine. [§5.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.3) specifies how binary representations of classes and interfaces are loaded by class loaders and how classes and interfaces are created. Linking is described in [§5.4](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4). [§5.5](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.5) details how classes and interfaces are initialized. [§5.6](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.6) introduces the notion of binding native methods. Finally, [§5.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.7) describes when a Java Virtual Machine exits.
