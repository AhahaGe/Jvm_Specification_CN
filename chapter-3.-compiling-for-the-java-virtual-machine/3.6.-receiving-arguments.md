# 3.6. Receiving Arguments

If _n_ arguments are passed to an instance method, they are received, by convention, in the local variables numbered _1_ through _n_ of the frame created for the new method invocation. The arguments are received in the order they were passed. For example:

```text

int addTwo(int i, int j) {
    return i + j;
}

```

compiles to:

```text
Method int addTwo(int,int)
0   iload_1        // Push value of local variable 1 (i)
1   iload_2        // Push value of local variable 2 (j)
2   iadd           // Add; leave int result on operand stack
3   ireturn        // Return int result
```

By convention, an instance method is passed a `reference` to its instance in local variable _0_. In the Java programming language the instance is accessible via the `this` keyword.

Class \(`static`\) methods do not have an instance, so for them this use of local variable _0_ is unnecessary. A class method starts using local variables at index _0_. If the `addTwo` method were a class method, its arguments would be passed in a similar way to the first version:

```text

static int addTwoStatic(int i, int j) {
    return i + j;
}

```

compiles to:

```text
Method int addTwoStatic(int,int)
0   iload_0
1   iload_1
2   iadd
3   ireturn
```

The only difference is that the method arguments appear starting in local variable _0_ rather than _1_.
